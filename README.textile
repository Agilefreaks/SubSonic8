A simple client app for the popular "Subsonic":http://www.subsonic.org media server. Written for WinRT (latest and greates from Microsoft).

If you install the app and when switching away to another app the sound volume lowers automatically, and you are annoyed by this follow these steps:
1)Windows key + x
2)Control Panel
3)Hardware and sound
4)Sound
5)Speakers
6) Properties
6) Advanced
7) Disable the option "Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device"
8) Restart the application and... it works ;)
